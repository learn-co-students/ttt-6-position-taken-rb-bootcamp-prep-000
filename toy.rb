# 1)The underlying goal of this method is to check, or validate, user input against the current state of the game board. 
# 2 )In this particular example of our tic tac toe game, our entire game would 
# break if a user could overwrite board positions that are already filled out with an "X" or an "O". 
# Define a method that checks if a given space on the board is empty, i.e. equal to " ".
# Address the "edge cases" - scenarios that qualify as an empty space that
#  isn't equal to the literal " ". For example, we would want to consider "" to be an empty space as well.


board = [" "," "," "," ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " "]

index = input_to_index(input)

index == 0
